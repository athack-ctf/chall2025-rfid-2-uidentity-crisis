    Apparently, you can now use an access card to fetch your university messages! They did that because people kept on forgetting their password. You can go test the new system downstairs.

    I heard that Roger received an important message this morning. Try to impersonate him and see what's there. It should not be too difficult: they literally just check the ID of the card to give you access!

    > Back in high-school, I used to run an underground parking pass traffic using that technique... but don't tell anyone

    ## About the Automatic Terrible Machine (ATM)
    At @HACK 2025, participants hacked a custom Automatic Terrible Machine (ATM) using RFID cards (the card mention above). 
    Since this challenge requires a physicla setup, we're sharing it - and the included pictures - for historical reference. 
    THe utilities used to create an operate ATM challenges are available [here](https://github.com/athack-ctf/chall2025-atm-rfid-utilities).
