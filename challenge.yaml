    Apparently, you can now use an access card to fetch your university messages! They did that because people kept on forgetting their password. You can go test the new system downstairs.

    I heard that Roger received an important message this morning. Try to impersonate him and see what's there. It should not be too difficult: they literally just check the ID of the card to give you access!

    > Back in high-school, I used to run an underground parking pass traffic using that technique... but don't tell anyone

    ## About the Automatic Terrible Machine (ATM)
    At @HACK 2025, participants hacked a dystopian ATM machine that operates on RFID cards. 
    Since this challenge requires a physical setup, we're sharing it - and the included pictures - as a fun throwback. 
    We published all utilities used to create and operate all ATM challenges [here](https://github.com/athack-ctf/chall2025-atm-rfid-utilities).
