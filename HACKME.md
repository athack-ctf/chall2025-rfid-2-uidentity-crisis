Apparently, you can now use an access card to fetch your university messages! They did that because people kept on forgetting their password. You can go test the new system downstairs.

I heard that Roger received an important message this morning. Try to impersonate him and see what's there. It should not be too difficult: they literally just check the ID of the card to give you access!
