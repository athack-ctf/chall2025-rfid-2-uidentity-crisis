# Chall - UIDentity Crises

> RFID challenge #1 - Participants have a USB reader, and an empty Mifare classic 1k card, with UID rewritable. They must change the UID of their card to impersonate the admin and get the flag.

## Type

- [X] **OFF**line
- [ ] **ON**line

## Designer(s)

- Hugo Kermabon-Bobinnec

## Description

Back in old days, some access card only used the UID of the card (hardcoded by the constructor) to authenticate someone. Nowadays, some cards have their UID writable, meaning that it's easy to bypass such authentications.
